Pipedrive is easy to navigate, easy to customize, and I love the at-a-glance dashboard. Also scheduling tasks and next steps is super simple. This is the CRM I've been waiting for.

One door closes and another opens...do.com's upcoming closure has lead me to Pipedrive which looks and feels pretty dang sweet.
