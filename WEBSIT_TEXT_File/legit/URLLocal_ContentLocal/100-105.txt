A buyer of vinyl. A rejecter of digital sound waves. You go old school. From the way you dress, to the car you drive – everything has a history, a story, a past. The old FM radio gifted to you from your uncle, who knew you’d had your eye on one for the last couple of years. Even as a teenager, whilst your friends adored Kurt Cobain’s lyrics, you were more interested in what Sammy Davis Junior was crooning about. Imagine playing soulful grooves on an impeccable record player. The classic tracks have never sounded better.
