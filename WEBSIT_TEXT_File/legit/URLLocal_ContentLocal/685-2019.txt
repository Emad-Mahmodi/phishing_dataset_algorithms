Where Do I Start?
This is a mammoth site packed with an enormous amount of info. If you're looking for something specific, use the search box above (it works just like Google) or the category tabs. If you just want to save, the main areas are:
Step 1: Grab the 'Martin's Money Tips e-mail'. The site's designed around the free weekly e-mail. It ensures you don't miss out as many loopholes are short-lived and need speedy grabbing. Over a year, follow the info and you'll give yourself a money makeover.
Step 2: Give yourself a Money Makeover. The specially designed Money Makeover guide takes you through the main areas you can quickly use to put cash in your pocket, and includes the free budget planner tool.
Step 3: Voyage into the Forums. MoneySavers are generally a kind bunch and will often answer questions and share suggestions. At any moment over 5,000 may be in the Forum's many discussion boards including Debt-Free Wannabe, Old-Style MoneySaving and the Grab-it while you can bargains board.
Who is Martin Lewis?
Martin Lewis OBE, Money Saving Expert, is an award-winning campaigning TV and radio presenter, newspaper columnist and best-selling author.
An ultra-specialised journalist, focusing on cutting bills without cutting back, he founded MoneySavingExpert.com in 2003 for £100. It's now the UK's biggest money site, with over 14m monthly users and 9m receiving the Martin's Money Tips email  and Martin is still its full-time Editor-In-Chief. He's often credited as the "big gob in chief" behind campaigns to reclaim Bank Charges, PPI and Council Tax with over 10 million template letters downloaded and many £billions repaid. Martin was awarded an OBE in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in June 2014. Other awards include Consumer Journalist of the Year and Citizens Advice Consumer Champion. He has also topped The Grocer's 2011 Retail Power100 list, was 5th in the Sunday Times Rich List Giving (Philanthropy) Index, and appeared in the 'charity and campaigning' section of the top 500 most influential people in the UK.
In 2009 Martin was revealed as the UK's most searched person by the web analysts Hitwise (in 2010, the last time the research was published, he was second to Cheryl Cole).
He is a governor of the London School of Economics, has an honorary doctorate from Chester University and, according to Google, was yet again the UK's most searched the UK's most searched British man in 2013.
How's the site financed?
MoneySavingExpert.com is free to use and free of advertising - you can't pay to have content put on the site. Articles are written based on specialised editorial research of the best ways to save money.
The income comes from links that generate revenue when clicked. Once articles are finished, where possible 'affiliated links' to the top products are used and have a * by them. Yet if no affiliate link is available a non-paying link is used; i.e. if the top pick doesn't pay, it remains the top pick regardless.
This stance means the top products detailed here often easily surpass those on the other money websites. Yet thankfully the sheer scale of MoneySavingExpert.com means it's very healthily in profit and also donates a good chunk of cash to the MoneySavingExpert.com Charitable Fund.

How this site works
We think it's important you understand the strengths and limitations of the site. We're a journalistic website and aim to provide the best MoneySaving guides, tips, tools and techniques, but can't guarantee to be perfect, so do note you use the information at your own risk and we can't accept liability if things go wrong.
This info does not constitute financial advice, always do your own research on top to ensure it's right for your specific circumstances and remember we focus on rates not service.
We don't as a general policy investigate the solvency of companies mentioned (how likely they are to go bust), but there is a risk any company can struggle and it's rarely made public until it's too late (see the section 75 guide for protection tips).
We often link to other websites, but we can't be responsible for their content.
Always remember anyone can post on the MSE forums, so it can be very different from our opinion.
MoneySavingExpert.com is part of the MoneySupermarket Group, but is entirely editorially independent. Its stance of putting consumers first is protected and enshrined in the legally-binding MSE Editorial Code.
Please read the Full Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy, Cookies Q&A, How this site is financed and MSE's Editorial Code.
