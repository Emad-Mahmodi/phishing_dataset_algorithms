 Options carry a high level of risk and are not suitable for all investors. Certain requirements must be met to trade options through Schwab. Writing uncovered options involves potentially unlimited risk. Covered calls provide downside protection only to the extent of the premium received and limit upside potential to the strike price plus premium received. With long options, investors may lose 100% of funds invested. Multiple-leg options strategies will involve multiple commissions. Spread trading must be done in a margin account. Please read the Options Disclosure Document titled Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options before considering any option transaction.
Brokerage Products: Not FDIC Insured • No Bank Guarantee • May Lose Value
