Uptime matters
Pingdom has the infrastructure to do website monitoring from all over the world, as often as every minute. When something breaks, because it will, you’re immediately alerted. We always double-check issues to avoid unnecessary disturbance. Once alerted you can notify your customers and dig in to see server response codes and web server output to analyze the situation.
Performance data from actual visitors
Do you know how your visitors experience your website, right now? Get invaluable insights into your website’s performance from actual visitors’ web browsers. You’ll learn about every visitor, one-by-one, in real time or during a selected time range. With this information you can then make data-driven decisions for improvements.
During the last hour we detected ... outages around the world
