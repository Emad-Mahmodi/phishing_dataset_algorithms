Sitting next to the man who raped and made her pregnant, Afghan woman forced to marry her attacker to avoid prison
Afghan woman known only by her first name Gulnaz, (pictured left) was just 16 years old when was raped by her cousin's husband, a man named Asadullah (pictured right), in 2008. She fell pregnant as a result of the rape. But in Afghanistan, sleeping with a married man is a crime, and it doesn't matter if the married person forced themselves on you. How sad! Rejected by her family and facing 12 year in prison for 'adultery by force' and falling pregnant for a married man, Gulnaz had no choice but to marry her depraved attacker. That was her only hope to get a reduced sentence. She later gave birth to the girl in the photo above.

Talking to CNN about her life, Gulnaz said she only agreed to marry her rapist so that her daughter - named Smile could live a shame-free life in the Afghan capital's 'traditional' society.
