RyanSmithAT: @IanCutress Overclocking. The answer is always overclocking
IanCutress: I ordered my gaming office chair. I could review it, but I wouldn't know where to start in order to do it justice on @AnandTech
IanCutress: @Poltymon Actively cooled Core M NUC or Core M BRIX would be interesting, but expensive
IanCutress: @Poltymon It'll be power draw vs temp. With enough coolant and the right firmware it could prob keep top turbo. Core M on LN2 would be fun
IanCutress: @agrammenos @kristianvatto @Jamatatrex 100/10 in the undergrad dorms in each room in 2004. Shame Steam was blocked then, but we VPN'ed it.
IanCutress: @kristianvatto @agrammenos @Jamatatrex I pay for the cheap London internet. £5 for 12/2
RyanSmithAT: RT @anandtech: Analyzing Intel Core M Performance: How 5Y10 can beat 5Y71 & the OEMs' Dilemma http://t.co/FO0f6T1o61
RyanSmithAT: Very proud of the data and work @BrettHowse and @IanCutress have been able to dig up on Core M performance: http://t.co/RHiGwtNRTj
RyanSmithAT: @HaeNyong Angela, the best way is to visit our About page and get in contact with the appropriate editor http://t.co/X2YdDYo7eg
RyanSmithAT: @Pridesterly @anandtech Look for the S6 review this week
ganeshts: @ASUSTechMKTJJ JJ, is that a Broadwell version? Is there a marketing push for it in the US?
ganeshts: @Krewell Agreed :) Btw, what is the link-rate between the two dies? I am not finding that info anywhere (wasn't part of the briefing)
ganeshts: @Krewell Genuinely curious if that matters to customer who cares about BOM cost & perf/watt :)
ganeshts: @smalltreecomm Does the product picture here: https://t.co/88q8JC3RZ3 : match the actual product?
ganeshts: @juhamattis Check for something with DZAT support. I have asked @kristianvatto to do some investigation on that.
