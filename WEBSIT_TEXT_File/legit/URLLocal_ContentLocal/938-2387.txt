Search help
?
Keywords help you find exactly what you're looking for.
How to use keyword search
Enter the terms of your search in the Keywords field, for example the job title barista or kitchen hand/cook (without quotes).
In addition to job title, you can include things like skill(s) and seniority (junior, senior, etc.) to make your search more targeted, for example junior barista or senior java developer oracle.
To refine further, you can use the filters such as Classification, Location and Salary.
You can choose multiple classifications and locations by using advanced search.
How search behaves
Job Search will always find a minimum of two words in a search query. For example, if your search query is HR and facilities administrator then Job Search will look for at least two matching words – i.e. jobs containing either 'HR administrator' or 'facilities administrator' (the 'and' in the query is ignored).
You can alter this default behaviour using Boolean logic – see Search Techniques below for examples.
Search techniques
You can use Boolean logic to tailor your search query by using words like OR, NOT and brackets ().
Techniques
Example
Use OR between each word if you want to search for individual words
sales OR management (finds all jobs with 'sales' and all jobs with 'management' in the description)
Use NOT to exclude certain words
sales NOT management (finds only the jobs which have 'sales' in the description and not ones with just 'management')
Use AND to broaden your search criteria
sales AND management (finds only the jobs which have both 'sales' and 'management' in the job ad)
Use a combination of techniques by using brackets
management NOT (sales OR account) (finds all 'management' jobs but not with 'sales' or 'account')
Use double quotation marks to search for a specific phrase (for example "search term")
"sales management" (finds jobs only with this specific phrase 'sales management')
Things to know about Keyword Search:
It is not case sensitive
It automatically ignores common words such as the, an, also
It ignores special characters like %, /
It interprets all spaces, commas, dashes and asterisks as AND
It recognises common phrases regardless of the spelling such as part time, part-time, parttime
General tips
By default, results are sorted by keyword match, so the results most relevant to your search criteria appear at the top.
To get the freshest results, sort by date – the most recently listed jobs will appear at the top.
Jobs that contain all of your search terms will generally appear above those which match on fewer terms.
If you don't get many results, try removing filters to widen your search
