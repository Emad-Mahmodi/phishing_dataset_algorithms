7 Modern Classics that are Great for Small Spaces
Abigail Ahern
So it might be a bit of a stretch to fit an Eames lounge chair into your 200 square foot studio apartment, but that doesn't mean you have to save the beautiful, iconic pieces for that time in the distant future when you can afford a mansion. There are quite a few modern designs that are a great fit for small spaces — and the good news is that some of these apartment-friendly pieces come with renter-friendly pricetags, too.

Natasha's Well-Traveled Brooklyn Studio Apartment
House Tour
Name: Natasha R. Johnson
Location: Bedford-Stuyvesant; Brooklyn, New York
Size: Approximately 500 square feet
Years lived in: 1.5 years; Rented
With no extra space to spare, Natasha was both deliberate and maximal in organizing the decorative and essential elements of her studio apartment. In the 35+ countries that she has lived and/or worked in as a college professor and international human rights attorney, she has assembled her fair share of global keepsakes. Despite the small footprint of her studio home, she has created a functional, eclectic, and cohesive atmosphere, meanwhile expressing her own interest and talent for DIY and the visual arts.

How To Clean a Brick Fireplace with All-Natural Cleaners
Apartment Therapy Tutorials
Tackling soot in your fireplace is a really messy, hands-on job. Though it might be tempting to use a powerful commercial cleanser to get the job done quickly, think about trying one of these all-natural options first; they are safe and just as effective as most commercial cleansers.

“Must Have A Bed Frame” and Other Dating Deal Breakers
Jeremy & David's Design Lovers' Den
Thorin over on Lifehacker is newly single, in his 30s, and recently polled some friends about their dating deal breakers. He was surprised to learn (as I am) that every single person he talked to said their potential partner needed to have a real bed frame at home. It's a very specific requirement, but what are some other red flags? If the home is a reflection of a person, what in their place would cause you to cut the connection? More importantly, are these signs of superficiality on your part, or do these things actually warn of bigger issues that are insurmountable in a future relationship?

This Cool Arched Building is Actually 2 Houses
Design News
Look closely, and you'll see that this arch house in Tokyo is actually two structures. Designed by Akio Nakasa of Japanese firm Naf Architect & Design, the pair slanted homes come together to form an arch with a slight gap at the top. Grandma lives in the single floor residence on the left, while a couple and children live in the one on the right.

Henry's "Room for Style" in San Francisco
House Call
Name: Henry
Location: San Francisco, CA
I believe that no matter the size of your home, there is always room for style! I live in a 1BR, 795 SF condo on the cusp of SOMA and Mid-Market. I share this space with my partner and our 11 year old chihuahua. We make the most out of our home by creating cross-functioning areas and we are conscientious of what we bring home.

8 DIY Art Ideas That Will Come Out So Good You’ll Want to Quit Your Day Job
For the record, Apartment Therapy DOES NOT suggest you quit your day job, even though these DIY art projects will in fact look great when you finish. The point we’re making with that hyperbolic title is that these eight DIY art projects aren’t just a fun way to fill up time on a lazy afternoon — they’re easy enough to pull off that the end result will be pretty darn impressive. We picked a mix of styles and techniques; there's bound to be something that will make you feel like an artist when you're done!

Win: A Luxury Mattress from Saatva!
Saatva
Prize: A luxury firm queen mattress set (including foundation and frame)
Value: $1,400
From: Saatva
Let me tell you about my dream night's sleep (pun intended): It involves a serene bedroom: a pile of blankets, two perfect pillows and one divine mattress. You may prefer one pillow to two, or a thin quilt to a plush duvet, but when it comes to the mattress, the right answer is always Saatva.
Saatva is accessible luxury: ultra-premium mattresses without the price tags to match. (Saatva doesn't have physical stores, so it can mark prices way lower.) It's also just a ridiculously comfortable mattress, because of something called "spinal zone" sleep technology – technically, Saatva's individually-wrapped coil system and foam layers work together to create the optimal spinal alignment for any body type – but you can just think of it as the reason you'll feel like you're sleeping on a cotton-candy cloud.
