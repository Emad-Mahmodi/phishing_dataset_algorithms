They charge you at the end of the process, just before e-filing it. It is the same as Turbo Tax.

Good deal indeed!
02/22/2015 04:47pm By Anonymous
It is $12.99 when I tried to file. Anybody knows why?
02/25/2015 07:18pm By Anonymous
Do not believe it. It is $19.99. Cheating! There are enough software to choose from.
02/27/2015 10:41pm By Anonymous
I have been using Taxact for 10 years. I never use deluxe version. I just file federal which is free. You can e file or print out to mail the paper. You also can save your return(1040) into your own computer.I use State tax file website( NJ )for my state tax return file which is free also.

taxact counts the social security tax and medicare tax as income tax, does anyone know how to correct this?

Filed online simple joint return federal + state for $11.99. Same refund shown by Turbo Tax but less expensive.

It won't work for State of Indiana partial year resident.
03/10/2015 11:17pm By Anonymous
Just finished both Fed and State, it even did the locality (city) one but I have to mail that one in. Pretty comprehensive in itemized deduction. I like it and much cheaper than other competitors.
03/30/2015 03:21pm By Anonymous
BTW, it still works, even for existent user. You don't need to create a new user name. Just use the old one and follow through the process and you will be all set.

04/04/2015 09:57am By Anonymous
Do you have to complete right now? If you start now and finish in 2 weeks, do you still get 11.99 deal?
04/04/2015 02:23pm By Anonymous
For those that commented that TaxAct resulted in the same refund as TurboTax, did you guys run the numbers through both software?
04/04/2015 02:26pm By Anonymous
Yes. It is a locked price for 2014 return. Does not matter you file it now or later.
04/04/2015 09:43pm By Anonymous
I tried turbotax and taxact, Federal is exactly the same but states are not.
04/04/2015 10:54pm By Anonymous
How to get the promotion price? It show up $21.99
04/06/2015 01:55pm By Anonymous
Both Federal and State exactly the same with Turbotax Deluxe, with equity investments, dividends and interest. Both State and Federal with efiling was just under 12 dollars! Thanks for the great deal. Also, I find that some interface of TaxAct were actually better than turbotax.
04/07/2015 12:21pm By Anonymous
I don't see the 11.99 either
04/09/2015 02:06am By Anonymous
Tax Act sucks. very little explaination comparing to Turbotax.
I did not fill in address for my dependent care then it does not count the deuction at all! I need to pay 3000$ more tax if I did not find this bug!
04/09/2015 09:20am By Anonymous
Not $3000 more tax. it is $3000 *(-.35 ~ 0.2) ~ $600 to $1050 more tax.

actually, he is about right, you pay $95 for a $100 gift card, then you use the $100 gift card to buy another one for $95. Then you end up paying $95 for getting two gift cards ($5 and $100). 9.5% off, very close to $10% off.

The rule is you can not buy gift card with coupon or another gift card.they are not si11y.

I bought the g2 last time when it was around this price and using t-mobile lte since. I got speed of 50mb down and 24mb up at night time and also 25mb down with 16 mb up at day time. compare to my high speed cable time warner service only gives me 15mb down and 5mb up, I would said my at&t branded lg g2 is very fast on t-mobile service.

works fine with T-mobile 4G LTE if you lives in the city. Even in some suburb not too far from the city you might lose some LTE connections, since 4G is only for model D801 so you will get 2G only.

Go to truecar.com get an average price paid, and most importantly select the options carefully match the same vehicle you are purchasing. Then you go to the dealership and hand to him the print out how much the average priced paid for the vehicle. He will wondering around for a while, because he wonder where else he can make more money ( he already knows the rebate and incentive), such as maintenance fee and insurance / protection, tinted windows extras. Be sure you know the rebate and take that into consideration that's his commission as well.

$.5/gb is expensive. Bargin is $.3/gb. You can spend it but it depends on demand. Not worth it if you just emailing, word, excel....
03/12/2015 07:25pm By Anonymous
you can always wait 10 years until the technology that you want is about 10% the current price or you can spend that 100% and get what you want right now. Thank you very much for stating the obvious.

guys, this is TLC right?
04/10/2015 11:29am By Anonymous
Does that even matter? Samsung 3D V-NAND TLC has more than sufficient P/E for consumer use. When are people going to stop asking about TLC/MLC questions which are almost completely irrelevant now.
04/10/2015 11:33am By Anonymous
Ohh. again TLC and MLC? This is has 10 year warranty. Who cares TLC or MLC?

$.47/GB is kind of high for sshd. If you are a gamer or Business, this is the hard drive for you. All other this is overkill.

"Google said it will be compatible with iphone soon." What do you mean compatible? New Google wear? or the same watch but new software?
04/10/2015 05:06pm By Anonymous
All they need to do is make an IOS version of Android Wear. It can be done in days if apple allow it.
But Apple is very greedy, they want to punish their fanboys by making them spend 2 to 200 times more on apple watch.

Over priced. Before iphone only Nokia price was above 300. Seemed people used to, and happy with the cost of fashion.

In Japan Softbank sometimes offers free iphone for 2 years contract. After this May, carriers in Japan could not SIM lock the phone. That is not too bad as a deal.

Is this no contract and not prepaid? If it is, it should be a good deal if you want to use page plus. The strange thing is that it says early termination fee although it doesn't say you need a 2 year contract.
04/10/2015 09:43am By Anonymous
pretty sure it will work with pageplus just check out kitty wireless forum. Pageplus is great for single line, or you plan on not using too much data. Either way if you are going with CDMA there isn't really a need to switch carrier.
