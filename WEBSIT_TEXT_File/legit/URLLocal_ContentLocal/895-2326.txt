Young Guv
Ripe 4 Luv
March 10, 2015
Indie Pop
So far, Young Guv's Ripe 4 Love is the best power pop album of 2015. Chances are, once December comes around, it'll still be the best power pop album of 2015 because it not only has hooks and songs but it has a feel that uncannily recalls the skinny-tie peak of 1980.

Tommy Guerrero
