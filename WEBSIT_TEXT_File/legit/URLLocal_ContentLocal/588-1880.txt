How to remove your info from almost every background check site on the planet
How to remove your info from almost every background check site on the planet
By Zach Epstein about 40 mins ago.
Most background check sites are just awful. They scrape public records from across the country and compile data about everyone they possibly can. That data is often incomplete, outdated and even inaccurate. Then, they bait people in by displaying preliminary results for free searches along with a message that additional information is available at a price.
To make matters even worse, they never obtain permission from people listed on the site, and they don’t have to since all the info they collect is public.
Thankfully, there are ways to have your info removed from nearly every single one of these sites, but you had better brew a fresh pot of coffee because this is not going to be an easy process. More ?

Don’t trash your Apple Watch’s box – it may actually be an important part of the product
Don’t trash your Apple Watch’s box – it may actually be an important part of the product
By Chris Smith about 1 hour ago.
Images supposedly showing the retail box of the Apple Watch have been leaked and reveal the device will apparently feature some sort of a display stand that might be used for battery charging purposes, as Cult of Mac reports. Apparently, the display stand can be folded out of the Apple Watch’s box and Cult of Mac says the box can be used as a charging stand, although the pictures are yet to be confirmed by Apple. More ?

More than 20 of the worst (and best) online advertising fails ever
More than 20 of the worst (and best) online advertising fails ever
By Zach Epstein about 2 hours ago.
Catching people’s attention as they browse the web isn’t easy, and advertisers are constantly coming up with ways to make online ads flashier and catchier. Of course, there are also some advertisers that, in hindsight, would likely preferred it if people had not seen their ads because of some unfortunate ad placement.
You have to see these to believe them. More ?

Want the fastest version of Apple’s new Retina MacBook? Get ready to fork over at least $250 more
Want the fastest version of Apple’s new Retina MacBook? Get ready to fork over at least $250 more
By Chris Smith about 2 hours ago.
Much has been said about the 12-inch Retina MacBook’s performance. The new laptop that isn’t on par with what the Air and Pro have to offer in terms of raw power, but it will still offer a more-than-capable computing experience packed into a shockingly slim case. Even so, buyers looking to get their hands on Apple’s slimmest and best-looking MacBook to date this Friday should know there’s also a slightly faster MacBook in Apple’s lineup. Of course, the device is unsurprisingly even more expensive than the models Apple initially announced. More ?

Xbox One is about to become every cord cutter’s dream console
By Jacob Siegal about 3 hours ago.
This might be a fairly specific scenario, but if you own an Xbox One and are on the fence about signing up for a cable subscription, Microsoft might have just made the decision for you. On Wednesday, the Xbox team announced that it would be bringing over-the-air TV functionality to Xbox One owners in the United States and Canada. More ?

Apple employee quits his job, spills dirt on ‘what really goes on’ there
Apple employee quits his job, spills dirt on ‘what really goes on’ there
By Brad Reed about 3 hours ago.
Working at Apple is a dream job for some but a nightmare for others, particularly those who value having free time. Via Business Insider, an ex-Apple employee named Ben Farrell recently quit his job at the company and penned a not-too-happy blog post about what it’s really like to work for the company. It goes without saying that Farrell, who “spent two years in the Apple camp managing customer service improvement for their technical support contact centers,” seems very happy to no longer be working at the company.

Fantastic news: Early reviews all say the Apple Watch’s battery life is better than expected
Fantastic news: Early reviews all say the Apple Watch’s battery life is better than expected
By Yoni Heisler about 3 hours ago.
Ever since the Apple Watch was first unveiled this past September, one of the looming questions about the device has been how well the battery might fare during the course of a normal day’s usage. Initially, Apple was extremely coy about the device’s battery life, only to reveal this past March that users can expect about 18 hours of battery life throughout a typical day.
But now, with the first round of Apple Watch reviews finally out in the wild, we can finally take a look and see whether or not battery life on Apple’s ballyhooed wearable is as solid as advertised. As with any new Apple product release, the first collection of Apple Watch reviews are exhaustive and extremely long. To help interested buyers cut to the chase, below is a sampling of the more pertinent reviews as they pertain to Apple Watch battery performance.

The Galaxy S6 might have a very serious problem with its camera flash
By Chris Smith about 4 hours ago.
The Galaxy S6 won’t be officially available in stores until April 10th, but some early buyers have already received their units. Unfortunately, some of these early Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 edge models may have some issues. A few days ago, reports said that some Galaxy S6 units shipped to buyers with screen defects out of the box, and now some customers are complaining on the xda-developers forums of a faulty Galaxy S6 camera flash.

The amazing hidden Apple Watch details you won’t see in any other smartwatch
By Chris Smith about 4 hours ago.
Apple went to great lengths to ensure its Apple Watch is as close to perfection as possible, a new report from Wired indicates, as the company remained faithful to an old design concept inherited from Steve Jobs – focusing on the smallest details, even though not all customers may notice them. The publication talked to Apple’s human-interface chief Alan Dye about the watch faces in the device, and he revealed many interesting hidden design details about the thorough work behind them.

The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt preview: Slaying griffins and saving townsfolk
By Jacob Siegal about 5 hours ago.
Unlike its predecessors, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn’t going to scare you away. At least, not at first.
The Witcher 3 has been one of my most anticipated games of the past two years, but I was hesitant to get too excited about it because of the inevitable learning curve. I knew CD Projekt Red was going to kick my ass, and I had no way to know if I’d be prepared to deal with it.
Thankfully, the structure and pacing of the game has changed significantly to accommodate the new open world setting. More ?
