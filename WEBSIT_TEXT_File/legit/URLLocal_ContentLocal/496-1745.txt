Critic reviews
Ice Cream Social
Tacoma News Tribune
Critic from Seattle • 469 Reviews
Some salted caramel ice creams tune too high on caramel, with salt playing a drab supporting role. Not at Ice Cream Social. The Tacoma ice cream storeâ€™s version of salted caramel ice cream seesaws beautifully between salty and sweet. Full Review

Critic from Seattle • 1698 Reviews
The cavatelli with lamb and pork Bolognese is as good as it gets with the addition of carrots to brighten the flavor, but, again, scant in portion for its price. The most plentiful of the pastas is the rabbit-and-mushroom lasagne with porcini cream and fried onions. It too is exceptional: a lovely play on the woods with its game and fungi... Full Review

Critic from Seattle • 43 Reviews
Lisa Nakamura's new project, Gnocchi Bar, will serve its first official dinner tonight starting at 5 p.m. after a few soft openings. Nakamura plans to serve dinner only at first, later adding lunch and brunch. Full Review

Blogger from Vancouver • 27 Posts
My family and I decided to snack at Din Tai Fung at University Village in Seattle a few weeks back. Based on the popularity and raging reviews about this place, it triggered us into desperately wanting to give this place a try! The restaurant can certainly accommodate large groups of parties at once; however, because it is so well-known, it can... Full Review

Blogger from Seattle • 113 Posts
Rainier Restaurant and BBQ is one of the OG Vietnamese restaurants in Seattle. Rainier BBQ has always been a hit for Vietnamese folks for its traditional family style dinner dating back to the early 90s on Rainier Ave. Now itâ€™s quite the big deal in Seattle especially after the visit from our food superhero Anthony Bourdain. It has a right to be... Full Review

I expect that many young, monied people will Uber their way to the stylish Girin to swig makgeolli out of metal bowls and devour plates of meats that run from raw to grilled. Full Review

Bar Cantinetta
Not French? Still Pretty Good.
Likes it
Diner from Seattle • Ken Goldstein • 130 Reviews
I was disappointed to see Bar Cantinetta come in and break up the "Little Paris" theme in that stretch of restaurants, but after eating there I felt a lot better. All of the dishes we've had there were well-prepared, and I'd especially recommend the risotto with artichokes. I tend to end up at the bar a lot, and this is one of my favorites.

Our Favorite Restaurant in the Area

Diner from Seattle • Ken Goldstein • 130 Reviews
Luc is always a special treat for us. When we're not ordering the special fish, the White Bean Cassoulet is my favorite dish, just a lot of hearty, satisfying goodness, usually accompanied by the Salade Lyonnaise.

Crazy Pho Cajun
Best Chicken Banh Mi I have had in Seattle!
Likes it
Diner from Seattle • mindylmshaw • 11 Reviews
The Chicken Banh Mi is that good...it is I feel like I am back in Vietnam good. The chicken was tender, full of flavor and perfectly cooked. I also enjoyed the spring roll - very fresh and tasty. Full disclosure I ordered this meal through peach'd so I can't describe the dining experience. But I do know that the food is excellent - even delivered through a service (sometimes meals sit for a bit and the delivery isn't amazing) and that the next time I am in the neighborhood I will be stopping back through to have another.
