Why People Love Sidekick
Scott L
“One of the best tools I've found for retaining new clients, and pitching new ones. It's timely, on target and helps me organize my daily call and to do lists. Great app.”
Reggie L
“I had been looking for a way to have a receipt returned to me when someone read an email sent in G-mail. Now, I have it. I get confirmation and can better track who just hasn't checked their inbox and who hasn't responded.”
Joe J
“Sidekick by HubSpot provides actionable intelligence throughout the course of my day. The alerts let me know how my prospects, clients and team members are interacting with my communications.”
Jethro N
“Brilliant App, syncs perfectly with both Gmail and Outlook client. Able to watch in real time as everyone I email opens my emails. Gives such great transparency to an email conversation and beyond!”
