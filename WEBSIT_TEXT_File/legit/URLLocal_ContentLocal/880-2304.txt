From Our Customers
ZoomInfo's business data is the best I have ever used. Our email bounce rate with ZoomInfo data is only 3.5 percent. With ZoomInfo's competitors, it's 15 to 20 percent. We do a lot of email campaigns and none performed as well as the ones that use ZoomInfo.
- Bryan Poss, netFactor
We are definitely targeting people more accurately with ZoomInfo. The emails we send and the marketing campaigns we're running are hitting the right people, which has saved us time and helped us close multiple deals in the past year.
- David Doucette, Creative Computing Inc.
