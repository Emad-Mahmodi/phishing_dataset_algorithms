Dear uploaders, Please add links to TV SHOWS via TV SHOWS FORM not MOVIE FORM. And fill ALL fields which are there with VALID data. Those who fail to understand this simple requirement will be punished. Linkers will be demoted then banned, non-likers will be banned right away. Thank you. PS. those who do not receive notifications for new movies and episodes and see some movies "broken" or episodes missing can thank those beautiful uploaders that cannot fill forms properly.

Updating Links! SparkyKarl M, 5 months ago

Hello, I've been meaning to address this issue for some time now, well I say "Issue" it's not really an Issue but something that needs to be put out there for Linkers / Uploaders too see. A lot of the time I see that Linkers / Uploads forget or can not be bothered to update there links, and by that I mean by deleting a CAM Quality link when HD or DvD Quality finally becomes available, because lately I've been coming across movies that still have CAM Quality links still available a year later when DVD / HD links have been posted. Like I said, it's not a problem for Mod's to deal with this, but it makes it a lot easier for everyone else if we can help each other, because after all Solarmovie is a "Community based site" Thanks for understanding! SparkyKarl.

Hello fellow Solarians, Few weeks ago we warned our users about a mandatory login change and today it happened. All login names were changed and if you are unable to login - you can check your new name [http://www.solarmovie.so/new-n...]. We also got a new feature for you. We added a reply feature, so from now on if you click on reply, the message that you're replying to and the nickname of the recipient will be quoted in your message. And of course we nailed some nasty bugs.

Pretty good-cool-slick flick. 7.75/10. Cool story with some surprise twists. Good cast with a super hot chick and top level production. Definitely worth a watch.
