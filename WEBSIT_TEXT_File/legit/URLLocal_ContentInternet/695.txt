NEW AND NOTABLE
Southwest Side Story: Vol. 19
by Various Artists
world
Another great comp from the Numero Group, this one focusing on San Antonio, TX. Dusty, deep, moving soul songs that should’ve been classics.
slap bass hunks
by christian fitness
rock
The title doesn’t lie; the latest from Christian Fitness puts slap bass at the center of their gnarled, punky songs.
Deluxe
by Will Sessions
funk
Stunning, ragged-edged funk and soul—if you didn’t know this was new, it could be easily mistaken for a rarities comp from the late ’60s.
REFLECTIONS - MOJAVE DESERT
by Floating Points
electronic
Floating Points return with another album of vast, sprawling soundscapes that sound like Neu! on a trip to the moon.
Mulatu Of Ethiopia
by Mulatu Astatke
jazz
An Ethiojazz classic from the legendary Mulatu Astatke gets the full reissue treatment. Available on CD, LP, and 3xLP.

Do You Wanna b/w Need My Love
by Donnell Pitman & Wings of Sunshine
Cultured, soul soaked, boogie. This single is going to run and run.
Ultramarine - This Time Last Year
by Ultramarine
Sliding between the worlds of deep house, Ambient, melodic techno and stoned, often broken beats.
Infinite Instant
by Afrikan Sciences
A wonderful diverse EP of what is essentially machine expressed soul music.
