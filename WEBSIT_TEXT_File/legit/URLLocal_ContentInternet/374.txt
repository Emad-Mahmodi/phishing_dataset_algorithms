DESIGN TODAY
Bathroom & Kitchen
Make a plan to give your house and yourself a gift: Renovate your kitchen or bathroom this season to celebrate the New Year with a brand new look. Nothing enhances the convenience and subtle aesthetic quotient of your home more than a perfectly functioning and good looking bathroom or kitchen. Figure out your budget, then match your style and practical needs to it and create the perfect space. Remember not to think of these areas in isolation. Ideally, the bathroom and kitchen should carry forward the main design theme of your other rooms. For instance, if you have worked with a palette of vibrant colours in the rest of your home, do not opt for a black and white, post modern bathroom. It will stick out like a sore thumb and reek of a lack of taste

In this issue, check out the various design possibilities for these two spaces in our Design Focus section. Read our columnist Ankush Aggarwal's article to know more on the 'dos and don'ts' and handy tips to add style to these inner rooms. Also take a look at our products' section to know what is available in the market for the rooms. Elsewhere in the issue, check out two houses one in Delhi and one in Ahmedabad. Finally, the regulars: Design Stuff, In Store and Design Calendar are all packed in here for your reading pleasure this year-end.

MUSIC TODAY
Tabeer
'In his solo debut album 'Tabeer', the livewire voice of Shafqat Amanat Ali replete in its haunting beauty marries soul-stirring compositions to create an experience, which can only be termed as mind-blowing. A new sonic saga, this album defies the boundaries of language, styles, genres and musical cultures as singer-writer-composer Shafqat Amanat Ali meshes the old with the new, the earthy with the avant garde and lyrical beauty with sheer vocal might. SMS "TBR" to 54646 for exciting mobile downloads.
