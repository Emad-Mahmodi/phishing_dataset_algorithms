The Lesson We Seriously Need to Learn From Trophy Hunter Who Got Eaten By Crocodiles
Scott Van Zyl vanished last week after going on a hunting safari in Zimbabwe and now the remains of the father-of-two have been found inside two crocodiles. You’d think that we’d take some sort of celebratory stance in the face of a hunter facing karma, but we’re not going to go there. A man is dead, animals are still being hunted for no reason whatsoever and really the entire thing is pretty much awful. Zyl, whose company runs hunting trips for foreign clients, went on a hunting safari with a Zimbabwean tracker and a pack of dogs but when they left their truck, Zyl and the tracker walked into the bush in two different directions. Later that same day, Zyl’s dogs returned to the truck… but without

Russia claims it can wipe out US Navy with single 'electronic bomb'

The newsreader says: “Today, our Russian Electronic Warfare (REW) troops can detect and neutralise any target from a ship’s system and a radar, to a satellite.” The news report claims a single Russian war plane flew several times around American destroyer the USS Donald Cook in the Black Sea several years ago, disabling its systems and leaving it helpless. The report also claims they are capable to creating electronic jamming

Dear Abby: Fling with town tramp results in a baby
DEAR ABBY: My family has been put in a difficult position. Last year, a woman my brother had a one-night-stand with became pregnant. I have heard from more than one person that she’s known as the town tramp or “crazy.” We’re sure she planned it because he makes a good living and can support the child financially, and she insisted on keeping the baby. My brother, God bless him, is doing what’s necessary, although having a child with a woman he has come to despise weighs heavily on him. How should we, his family, handle this? At this point, I have no interest in laying eyes on her or her baby, blood kin or not. I feel no affinity for the child because I know my brother didn’t want it. Maybe in
