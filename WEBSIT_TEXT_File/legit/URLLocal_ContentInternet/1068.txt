Shamir
Hope
BY: CAMERON COOK3 HRS AGO
POP/R&B
Recorded on a four-track over a weekend, Shamir's sophomore album is the definition of a departure, moving from effervescent pop into a bracing new lo-fi world. 
Mr. Mitch
Devout
BY: LOUIS PATTISONELECTRONIC3 HRS AGO
UK grime fixture Mr Mitch’s latest LP explores a pared-back sound. It feels polished and tactile, with themes of loyalty, accountability, and fatherhood.
J Dilla
Motor City
BY: NATE PATRINRAP3 HRS AGO
This set of rare and unreleased Dilla instrumentals spans many of his styles, but the flat sequencing doesn’t do justice to his history of deeply focused vibe-building.
Kelly Moran
Bloodroot
BY: SETH COLTER WALLSEXPERIMENTAL3 HRS AGO
The composer and multi-instrumentalist Kelly Moran draws inspiration from John Cage’s “prepared piano,” extending the practice with electronic keyboards and melodic ingenuity.

John Mayer
The Search for Everything
BY: KATHERINE ST. ASAPH
ROCK
John Mayer suffers simultaneously from an excess of taste and an oblivious lack of it. It makes his seventh studio album neither sensitive nor scuzzy, just pleasantly bland.
San Fermin
Belong
BY: MARC HOGAN
ROCK
The third album from studied Brooklyn chamber-pop ensemble San Fermin benefits from a sharper focus. But its lyrics signify depth and meaning without quite delivering.
Hovvdy
Taster
BY: COLIN JOYCE
ROCK
The minimal Austin duo Hovvdy stack simple riffs in idiosyncratic ways. Their debut album rarely accelerates past a snail’s pace, but its interlocking pieces are deceptively complex.
Alexandra Savior
Belladonna of Sadness
BY: HILARY HUGHES
POP/R&B
The young American singer launches her career with a slinky, vintage album featuring production from Arctic Monkeys’ Alex Turner—though it sounds more like Turner side-project than a showcase debut.
