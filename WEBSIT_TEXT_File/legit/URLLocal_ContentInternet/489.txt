Reviewer: Dana from Arizona
OVERALL: COMFORT: LOOK:
Wasn't sure what I'd think, but cuter in person. Comfortable for all day wear.

OVERALL: COMFORT: LOOK:
Darling shoe, but the platinum was a little more bronze/gold than I like. I would have kept them, but I'm shopping for a specific occasion and these didn't work with my dress.
Jacks Mid Wedge
Posted: Apr 18, 2017
Reviewer: Paula Barksdale from Hermosa Beach CA
OVERALL: COMFORT: LOOK:
note that this wedge is cork and not stacked, as are some of the other mid-wedge Jack Rogers. Super cute and comfy but the size was WAY too small. I am a 5.5 or at most a 6. I couldn't even get my foot in these size 6 shoes. Way smaller than the normal stretching/breaking in would take care of.
Tanjun
Posted: Apr 18, 2017
Reviewer: Anthony from New Jersey
OVERALL: COMFORT: LOOK:
I do a lot of walking where I work and I wanted a comfortable sneaker to wear so I ordered the Nike Tanjun After three weeks of regular wear, I am very pleased with them. They are an excellent blend of lightweight and comfort and being breathable will be a great benefit during the soon-to-be hot weather. Will be purchasing and additional pair.

These just arrived yesterday and I have worn them around the house before going out today. They are true to size and VERY comfortable.

Gorgeous shoe ... high pitch so not great for lots of walking. But perfect for a night out!
On-The-Go 400 - Tropical
Posted: Apr 18, 2017
Reviewer: Anonymous from NV
OVERALL: COMFORT: LOOK:
I loved these so much that I immediately went online and bought another pair. I have arthritis in my foot, which unfortunately makes it impossible to wear my first love--flip flops. These work perfectly. So Comfortable.
