Caitlyn Jenner's Memoir Isn't Even Out Yet, But It's Already Up There With THESE 12 Juicy AF Tell-Alls!
4/20/2017 1:12 AM ET | Filed under: Bookz • Kris Jenner • Transgender • Caitlyn Jenner • LGBT
Caitlyn Jenner's tell-all, The Secrets of My Life, is already making waves and it hasn't even been released yet!
Set to hit bookshelves on April 25, we've been getting excerpts from her new memoir, including her thoughts on same-sex marriage, O.J. Simpson's trial, AND a BTS look at her relationship with Kris Jenner.
With the 67-year-old legit opening up about her "uncomfortable" sex life with the momager, we have a feeling this book is going to be one hell of a juicy read!
While fans await its release, ch-ch-check out which other celebs have bared their secrets in tell-alls (below)!

Scrubs Is Leaving Netflix! PLUS Everything Else Coming & Going In May!

After losing Buffy The Vampire Slayer last month, Netflix subscribers already have to say goodbye to ANOTHER of the most bingeable shows of all time.
On May 2, all nine seasons of Scrubs are leaving the streaming giant, along with Step Up, What About Bob?, and the original Jurassic Park films. Ouch.
Netflix will attempt to fill the void with lots of original programming, including new seasons of The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, Master Of None, and new true crime docuseries The Keepers.
Video: The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt Season Three Trailer
Hmm… At a certain point, Netflix is going to run out of comfort food, which used to be their bread and butter. Will all the hip new originals be enough?
Take a look at everything coming and going and let us know what YOU think (below)! Read the rest of this entry »

They were truly soulmates…
In her first U.K. interview in seven years, Celine Dion spoke to Bizarre's Dan Wootton about her upcoming European tour, and about the love of her life, late husband René Angélil. Last year, the manager lost his battle to throat cancer at the age of 73.
Sadly, the 49-year-old singer admits she will never get over her husband's death.

Survivor Star Zeke Smith Says Being Outed As Transgender Has Made Him 'Brave' & 'Bolder'!
4/19/2017 9:41 PM ET | Filed under: Reality TV • Transgender • LGBT
Zeke Smith, you truly are an inspiration!
As we reported last week, the Survivor: Game Changers star came out as transgender right before last Wednesday's episode where he was outed by now-eliminated contestant Jeff Varner.
On this week's episode of the hit CBS franchise, the show begins with Smith and co. at tribal council where they discuss the shocking incident they just witnessed.

While a couple of the tribemates (rightfully) vocalized their anger toward Varner, the trans Harvard graduate was glad they didn't create a bigger scene. The Oklahoma-native said: Read the rest of this entry »

The anger is REAL! Well, it's reality anyway.
We'd heard Kris Jenner was furious over what was in Caitlyn Jenner's upcoming tell-all The Secrets Of My Life, but now she's confirmed it in a brand new promo for this week's KUWTK.
Related: Caitlyn Claims Robert Kardashian KNEW O.J. Simpson Was Guilty!
Speaking to Kim and Khloe, the momager says:
"Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch and an asshole?...
I've never been so angry and disappointed in somebody in my whole life."
Wait, didn't they film months ago? Yep. Caitlyn was nice enough to provide Kris with an advance manuscript. So at least she isn't being caught off guard when the thing hits bookstores.
But see her furious reaction to Caitlyn's book (below)!
