How Humans Are Shaping Our Own Evolution
ADAPTED TO A DESERT CLIMATE8,000 Years ago: The desert presented an evolutionary challenge for the inhabitants of Sahul, the continent that once united Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania. After the ancestors of modern Aboriginals made the crossing to Sahul, around 50,000 years ago, they developed adaptations that allowed them to survive below-freezing temperatures at night and days often exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. A genetic mutation in a metabolism-regulating hormone provides this survival advantage, especially for infants, by modulating the excess energy that’s produced when body temperature rises.

About This Month's Cover Story:
Like other species, we are the products of millions of years of adaptation.
Modern humans migrated from Africa between 80,000 and 50,000 years ago. Our original genetic makeup was appropriate for the warm climates where we first evolved from early hominins to humans, from knuckle-walkers to hunters and gatherers. But a lot has happened since then, as humans have expanded around the world and the demands posed by new challenges have altered our genetic makeup.
Real-life examples of this evolution are everywhere. Australian Aboriginals living in desert climates have a genetic variant, developed in the past 10,000 years, that allows them to adjust more easily to extremely high temperatures. The ancestors of all non-Africans came out of Africa with dark skin. As recently as 10,000 years ago, researchers say, European and African skin looked much the same. But over time humans in darker northern climates evolved less heavily pigmented skin, which helped absorb the sun’s ultraviolet rays and synthesize vitamin D more efficiently. Researchers have uncovered a variety of adaptions in Andeans, Ethiopians, and Tibetans that allow them to breathe efficiently at high altitudes.
But what if humans could develop ways to speed up the typically long process of evolution?
In our April cover story, you’ll see how technology is creating new frontiers for human development, faster than our ancestors could have dreamed. From implants that give “cyborg” humans greater capabilities, to gene-editing tools that could bring about human-directed evolution, the pace of change could be breathtaking.
