Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko. add
HenNeko was a pleasure to watch. Plain and simple. The story is about Yoto Yokodera, a perverted idiot (typical harem trope) who is tired of not showing his real emotions and not being honest with himself. His friend (Ponta) suggests him to make a wish to the "Stony Cat", in which if you wish for something on it, it will come true. Then, a girl name... read more

Fruits Basket add
This anime I found to be super boring and so far has been the only anime I have disliked. The characters are very plain and cliché. There is almost no plot, the story predictable and dreadful. The events that happened was very unlikely and too perfect even in the world of anime. There is almost no character development. This anime was bad from the characters... read more
