My shopping experience so far has been very user friendly. I also like the security that is used. It gave me piece of mind and allowed me to trust namecheap.com with my personal information.

* Disclaimer
The free Comodo Certificate will cover the remaining original time of your current Symantec SSL and can be applied only to the domain associated with that SSL.
At the expiration date of your free replacement SSL certificate, Namecheap will contact you with instructions how to extend your new Comodo SSL.
Comodo certificates will be issued for the maximum validity term. EV SSLs will be issued as 24-month certificates and DV and OV SSLs as 36-month certificates.
After the free replacement period, a customer may choose to extend the current certificate by paying Namecheap for the remaining period on the certificate. If the customer chooses not extend after the free period, the certificate will be revoked.
Some orders may be flagged for an additional "Brand Validation" procedure by the Certificate Authority. This is a necessary security measure to verify your site. If the order is flagged for Brand Validation, SSL issuance will be delayed for a period of time deemed necessary by the Certificate Authority.
Our platform will match you automatically with a similar Comodo SSL based on the original Symantec SSL you have.
Valid for Symantec, GeoTrust, Thawte, RapidSSL single or multi domain SSLs.
