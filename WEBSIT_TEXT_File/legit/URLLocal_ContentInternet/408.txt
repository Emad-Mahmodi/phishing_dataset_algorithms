The first time we posted Tripp Lite’s 6 Rotateable Outlet Surge Protectors on Kinja Deals, I immediately bought three. That was over a year ago, and they’ve come in handy countless times since then, with no issues to speak of.

Considering Nintendo’s bizarre decision-making process, it’s nice to hear that the company may be doing the correct and obvious thing and releasing a SNES Classic this holiday season. Here are the games I’d put on it if I were in charge.
Modder Makes Over $4,000 A Month Adding A Lot Of Sex To The Sims 4

In the world of The Sims 4, life is a lighthearted cartoon. You can die of laughter and turn into a ghost. You can sleep with characters, but it’s not sex: instead, “Woohooing” happens out of sight, all giggles and hearts. For some people, The Sims 4 doesn’t go far enough in its portrayal of intimacy. (NSFW warning!)

R. Mika is a strong Street Fighter V character, maybe one of the best in the game. Despite receiving numerous adjustments by the developers in a recent patch, she continues to make her mark on the competitive landscape thanks to players like Du “NuckleDu” Dang and Keita “Fuudo” Ai.

I was only partially raised by my parents. They taught me some things: tying shoelaces, manners, the gentlemen’s sport of cricket. But growing up alongside Sierra adventure games, they taught me pretty much everything else, from asinine grammar to correct police procedure to the very alarming fact that almost…

Pandemic Legacy is a co-op board game that raises the stakes by adding permanent (actually permanent) changes to the board as you play, and it’s amazing. It also happens to be marked down to $39 on Amazon today, within a couple bucks of an all-time low.

Victor “PG Punk” Woodley took first place in Street Fighter V last Sunday night at the NorCal Regionals. Between that and his first place finish at West Coast Warzone the week prior, he’s all but guaranteed himself a top slot in the 2017 Capcom Cup.

Perhaps my favorite thing about the speedrunning community is how often they find clever, ridiculous ways to play games. Take Diablo II. Instead of simply doing a quick run through Blizzard’s iconic action game, a man going by the handle DrCliche decided to blaze through the game without attacking anything. It is…
