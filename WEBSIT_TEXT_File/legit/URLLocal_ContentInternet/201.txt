Spanish Dictionaries
There are two free Spanish-English dictionaries: our own dictionary and one from Collins. Each has its own strengths. Combined, they are unbeatable.
French and Italian Dictionaries
WordReference has two of its own dictionaries plus those of Collins. The French dictionary has over 250,000 translations and the Italian dictionary has nearly 200,000. These dictionaries continue to grow and improve as well. If you don't find what you are looking for in any of the dictionaries, search or ask in the forums.
