Write better code
Collaboration makes perfect. The conversations and code reviews that happen in Pull Requests help your team share the weight of your work and improve the software you build.
Manage your chaos
Take a deep breath. On GitHub project management happens in Issues and Projects, right alongside your code. All you have to do is mention a teammate to get them involved.
Security and administration
Boxes? Check.
We worried about your administrative and security needs so you don’t have to. From flexible hosting to authentication options, GitHub can help you meet your team’s requirements.
Code security
Prevent problems before they happen. Protected branches, signed commits, and required status checks protect your work and help you maintain a high standard for your code.
Access controlled
Encourage teams to work together while limiting access to those who need it with granular permissions and authentication through SAML/SSO and LDAP.
Hosted where you need it
Securely and reliably host your work on GitHub.com. Or, deploy GitHub Enterprise on your own servers or in a private cloud using Amazon Web Services, Azure or Google Cloud Platform.
