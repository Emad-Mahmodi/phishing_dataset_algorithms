MALIA OBAMA
SECRET SERVICE AGENTS DETAIN MAN
After Marriage Proposal
4/19/2017 1:15 PM PDT
BREAKING NEWS
Malia Obama's day at the office was interrupted by a guy asking her to marry him ... and her Secret Service agents took him into custody because he has a bad track record with the White House.
Law enforcement sources confirm 30-year-old Jair Nilton Cardoso was detained after he showed up on April 10 at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan where Malia is interning. We're told the man held a sign up against an office window ... loudly proposing marriage to the former First Daughter.
Agents kicked him out, but 2 days later he showed up again outside another building where Malia was working. This time agents recognized him as a guy who'd attempted to get into the White House multiple times.
They interviewed Cardoso and determined he needed psychiatric evaluation and took him to a hospital.
He was not charged with a crime, as the NY Daily News first reported.

RICHARD SIMMONS
WEIRD VISIT BY COPS
4/19/2017 12:22 PM PDT
EXCLUSIVE
Richard Simmons got a mysterious visit Wednesday from the LAPD.
Cops were walking the grounds of Simmons' estate, and it's particularly odd because Richard wasn't there ... he's in the hospital dealing with gastrointestinal issues.
There was a car accident outside his home Saturday, but we're positive it's unrelated to that ... the cops already handled that one.
It can't be about a welfare check because we know the LAPD was aware Richard had his manager take him to the hospital Monday ... and he's still there.
Lots of mystery at the Simmons crib these days.

BILL O'REILLY
OFFICIALLY OUT AT FOX NEWS CHANNEL
4/19/2017 11:41 AM PDT
BREAKING NEWS
Bill O'Reilly is officially out at Fox News Channel.
FNC's parent company -- 21st Century FOX -- released a statement saying, "After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O'Reilly have agreed that Bill O'Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel."
O'Reilly departs in the wake of numerous sexual harassment allegations by female co-workers ... the latest of which is a woman who anonymously said through her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, that O'Reilly would leer at her and call her "hot chocolate."
The company has already paid upwards of $13 mil in settlements involving sexual harassment claims against the talk show host.
Despite a mass exodus from at least 70 advertisers, O'Reilly's show remained the undisputed top cable news program. O'Reilly announced his current vacation on air and said he'd return April 24.
O'Reilly had been at the network since its start-up days ... creating what was then called "The O'Reilly Report" in 1996.

DONALD TRUMP
DISSES TOM BRADY
... Doesn't Mention QB's Name
4/19/2017 11:22 AM PDT
BREAKING NEWS
Seems Donald Trump isn't happy with Tom Brady -- because he didn't mention the QB's name ONCE at the White House ceremony honoring the New England Patriots.
Of course, Brady did not attend the ceremony, citing "personal family matters" -- shocking considering the two were supposedly friends. 
Donald Trump has sung Brady's praises publicly on numerous occasions, saying he is the greatest QB who ever lived -- so for him to go radio silent during the ceremony sends a strong message ... he's pissed. 
By the way, Trump shouted out a bunch of Patriots players by name including Danny Amendola, Julian Edelman, Matt Slater, Malcolm Mitchell and Trey Flowers.

KEVIN GATES
STUCK IN JAIL AFTER
JUDGE DENIES BAIL
4/19/2017 1:06 PM PDT
EXCLUSIVE
Rapper Kevin Gates better learn to get cozy in his cell because a judge just DENIED him bail ... meaning he'll remain behind bars.
Kevin had a bond hearing Wednesday at the Bridgeview Courthouse in Illinois but the judge said no dice on bond in his weapons case.
He'll remain at Kendall County Jail. It's unclear why he was denied bond.
You'll recall the rapper came THIS close to tasting freedom in Florida after completing his sentence there for kicking a woman in the face at one of his shows back in 2015.
But he was arrested on an outstanding warrant in the weapons case as he was being processed out of jail.
Oops.

JACKIE WARNER
LECTURED BY JUDGE IN DUI AMBIEN CASE
4/19/2017 11:20 AM PDT
EXCLUSIVE
Jackie Warner got a lecture from a judge Wednesday about taking Rx pills and driving, but she insists what happened on a West Hollywood street had NOTHING to do with abusing her Ambien prescription.
Jackie and her lawyer, Shawn Holley, were in court Wednesday morning and pled not guilty to DUI. The fitness star crashed her car into a pole and then tried to leave, clipping a police car.
The judge told Jackie a condition to her bail was that she could not drink, take pills and then drive. That seems to talk past Jackie's point ... that she took an Ambien and remembers nothing about getting in a car without pants and driving until she crashed.

The cast of the upcoming Snoop Dogg movie, "Grow House," made themselves a little too much at home at the W Hotel in L.A. ... and got the fire dept. called on them.
Snoop's co-stars Xzibit, Lil Duval, and the writer/director, DJ Pooh, were doing interviews with Civilized at the hotel Monday when they decided to do what they do -- get high! Problem is ... smoke detectors are pretty good in hotels.
The W's staff looked pissed -- having to evacuate everybody and all. Everyone else though ... looked totally chill. Wonder why? Also not shocking ... "Grow House" comes out 4/20.

'Need Help?'
4/19/2017 9:50 AM PDT
Rob Gronkowski offered his services to the Trump Administration Wednesday morning -- crashing Sean Spicer's White House briefing to ask if he needed any help!
Of course, Gronk's in town with the rest of the New England Patriots (minus Tom Brady and a few others) to visit President Trump for winning the Super Bowl.

Meantime, the players who did show up took a photo at the White House along with team owner Robert Kraft and a bunch of their Super Bowl trophies.
Notable players besides Brady who appear to have skipped the 1600 Penn visit ... Danny Amendola, Dont'a Hightower, LeGarrette Blount, Martellus Bennett, Devin McCourty?, James White, Michael Floyd, Chris Long, Dion Lewis, Patrick Chung, and Malcolm Butler.

CHRIS BROWN'S LAWYER
KARRUECHE'S OUT FOR SELF-PROMOTION
Domestic Violence Claims are B.S.
4/19/2017 10:46 AM PDT
EXCLUSIVE
Karreuche's manager Jacob York calls Geragos' claims laughable ... telling us it's insane to think Karreuche would take legal measures against Chris just for press. York adds, "please don't use Karreuche's name to distract from your client's current negative issues ... let's handle it in court."
Chris Brown is the victim of a bunch of thirsty people who make fake allegations to make themselves more famous, and Karrueche Tran is on that train ... so claims Brown's lawyer.
Karrueche's restraining order hearing was put off again Wednesday because she still hasn't been able to locate Brown to serve him with legal docs. Tran claims Chris has punched her, pushed her down the stairs and threatened to shoot her.
Brown's lawyer, Mark Geragos, tells TMZ her claims are bogus, adding, "A lot of people use Chris to enhance their profile."
Geragos says Karrueche's restraining order case is "doomed to failure."
As for why Geragos hasn't simply accepted service on behalf of Chris, he says, "I'm not here to help anybody increase their profile for self-promotion."

BREAKING NEWS
Serena Williams is 5 months pregnant, and even though she just announced it to the world ... she's barely showing.

EXCLUSIVE DETAILS
Great news ... Brooke Hogan's missing dog, Molly, has been FOUND -- and she's alive and well and totally not eaten by coyotes!!!! 
As we previously reported, Molly -- an 11-year-old Pomeranian -- went MIA on Monday night while Brook's friend was dog sitting.
The big fear ... Molly was lost in the San Fernando Valley which has an issue with coyotes hunting small pets. Jessica Simpson's dog was snatched a few years ago.
But Molly SURVIVED!!!
Brooke tells us a Good Samaritan found Molly after a 24 hour search and posted her photo on a lost dog website. The person who found Molly was several miles away from where she went missing.
Brooke sent us a thank you message once she got Molly home safely.

BARB FROM 'STRANGER THINGS'
COMES OUT AS BI
Apologizes to LGBT Fans
4/19/2017 10:05 AM PDT
Shannon Purser -- who plays Barb on "Stranger Things" -- came out as bi this week, and apologized to fans who thought her show was misleading the LGBT community.
Shannon posted the news Tuesday night in response to online backlash over her show, "Riverdale" ... which fans accused of queerbaiting. If you're unfamiliar, that's when a show teases fans into thinking characters are gay to build an audience, but ultimately they turn out to be straight.
"Riverdale" was accused of doing that with it's characters Betty and Veronica ... pissing off a lot of Beronica worshipers. That's when Shannon got involved.
She posted an offensive tweet a fan sent her -- which Shannon felt harassed by -- and then announced ... she's bi.
