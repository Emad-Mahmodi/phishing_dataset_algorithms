Empowering Businesses with Cloud Based Engagement Solutions since 2005

Hello! Thanks for visiting Conduit. We’ve been empowering businesses to engage their customers since 2005. In fact, our visionary, cloud-based technology helped us become Israel’s first billion-dollar Internet company. In 2010 we founded Como (formerly known as Conduit Mobile), and we are now pioneering CLM (Customer Loyalty Management) with our end-to-end solution, Como Premium.

Como Premium features a customized, branded mobile app and management console that integrate customer engagement, smart loyalty programs, autopilot tools, dynamic content, actionable business data and insights, and social interaction—all in one modular, infinitely flexible platform.

I invite you to explore Como Premium for yourself and start your journey to lasting customer relationships and business success.
