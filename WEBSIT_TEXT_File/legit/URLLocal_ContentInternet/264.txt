Spider Webs
Many spiders use webs of proteinaceous fibers extruded from silk-spinning organs, called spinnerets, to catch prey without having to expend energy pursuing it. However, constructing a web is an energetically costly process, and it is not uncommon for a spider to eat its own web each day to recoup some of the energy expended in its spinning. A remarkable material, spider silk possesses a tensile strength comparable to that of high-grade steel and has been used in medical settings to do what? More... Discuss

Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger Is Elected Pope (2005)
Ordained in 1951, the German-born Ratzinger came to be regarded as the most influential person in the Catholic hierarchy after the pope through his high-profile positions within the church and his uncompromising stance on Catholic teachings. He presided over the funeral of Pope John Paul II as dean of the College of Cardinals and, after just two days and four ballots, was elected pope in one of the fastest papal elections in a century. Why did he pray not to be elected during the papal conclave? More... Discuss

Cerealia
Ceres was the ancient Roman goddess of grain and of harvests, often identified with the Greek goddess Demeter. The festival known as Cerealia was observed at various locations only by Roman matrons, who, for several days preceding the festival, abstained from wine and other carnal pleasures. People who were in mourning were not allowed to appear at the celebration. For this reason, the Cerealia was not observed after the Battle of Cannae, when 50,000 Roman troops were killed by Hannibal.
