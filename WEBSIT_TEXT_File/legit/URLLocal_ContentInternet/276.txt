"We have a duty to consult with Ealing residents when making decisions, big or small, that affect them?—?but surveying a diverse population on a wide range of issues is challenging for our lean staff to manage. SurveyMonkey Enterprise makes it easy for every department to run its own surveys, collect feedback, and act on what they learn."
